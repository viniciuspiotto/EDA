# Customer Churn Analysis for a Telecom Company

## Project Overview

This project presents an in-depth analysis of customer churn for a fictional telecommunications company. The primary objective is to identify the key factors and patterns that lead to customers discontinuing their services. By leveraging customer demographic data, subscribed services, and contract details, this analysis aims to provide actionable insights that can help the company develop effective retention strategies, reduce churn rates, and improve overall customer satisfaction.

## üéØ Core Objective

To analyze customer data to uncover patterns and identify the primary drivers behind customer churn. The ultimate goal is to answer the question: **"What are the common characteristics of customers who leave our service?"**

## üõ†Ô∏è Analysis Approach

The analysis will be conducted following these key steps:

1.  **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Handle missing values, correct data types, and merge the datasets to create a unified view for analysis.
2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Investigate the relationships between different variables and churn. This will involve:
    * Analyzing the distribution of churned vs. non-churned customers.
    * Visualizing how demographic factors (gender, age, dependents) correlate with churn.
    * Determining which specific services or contract types are associated with higher churn rates.
3.  **Insight Generation:** Synthesize the findings from the EDA to build a profile of a customer who is likely to churn.
4.  **Conclusion and Recommendations:** Provide a summary of the key findings and suggest data-driven strategies to the business for reducing customer churn.
